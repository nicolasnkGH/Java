# springboot-twilio
- Open and change application.yml
```yml
twilio:
  account_sid: #your account sid
  auth_token: #your auth token
  trial_number: # your trial number
```
- Run the application
- Start sending sms's
- That simple

# Notes
- This application needs a REST client in order to work correctly. The REST client that I used is Postman.
- The reason why that Postman is needed, is because we need an Android or IOS application that connects with 
the Java application.
